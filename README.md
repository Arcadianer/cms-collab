# CSM-Collab

This is a very bad implementation of some code to be used later in a google colab to use CMS with some jucy TPU power and an OPENAI-API. Maybe i can get realtime interference speeds then my with my 3090 TI.

For the original code look at: https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm

I also borrowed some code from: https://github.com/a8851625/ChatTTS-OpenAI-API

I dont know if i will write a good documentation as this is more or less just a Test. We will see...
